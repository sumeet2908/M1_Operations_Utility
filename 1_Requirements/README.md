## Description

* About project

  * calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic operations in mathematics , this Project which I am Implementing ,a included additional,subtraction,division,square,modulas etc .However, the input has to be in the form numbers.
  ( i.e 2+3,2-1)
  * The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation.we give 1 as a  command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is fast enough to operate all operations.in short it follow the proper logic. 
# Feature
*	we can calulate very fast
*	we can see the display,which operation to do 
*	it is easy to use
*	On encountering a division by 0 the display should read "Cannot divide by 0"

## SWOT
  * Strength
    * The ultimate strength Calculator is its fast,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

  * Weakneses

     * do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

  * Oppourtunities

     * The new technology market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already   one step ahead than other

  * Threats

     * The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
