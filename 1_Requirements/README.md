## SWOT
  * Strength
    * The ultimate strength Calculator is its fast,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

  * Weakneses

     * do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

  * Oppourtunities

     * The new technology market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already   one step ahead than other

  * Threats

     * The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
